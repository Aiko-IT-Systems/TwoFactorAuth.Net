# TwoFactorAuth.Net
.Net library for Two Factor Authentication (TFA / 2FA)

This is a .Net port of the [PHP TwoFactorAuth library](https://github.com/RobThree/TwoFactorAuth) (staying as close as possible to the PHP implementation, but using .Net conventions and codestyles).

This is a work-in-progress.

**TODO:**
* Document
* Create helpfile
* Create demo (MVC?) project
* Create NuGet package
