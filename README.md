# ![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobThree/TwoFactorAuth.Net/master/logo.png) .Net library for Two Factor Authentication

.Net library for [two-factor (or multi-factor) authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) using [TOTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) and [QR-codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code). This is a .Net port of the [PHP TwoFactorAuth library](https://github.com/RobThree/TwoFactorAuth) (staying as close as possible to the PHP implementation, but using .Net conventions and codestyles).
